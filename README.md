# Quad-page portfolio
Quad-page portfolio with home, photos, videos and contact pages.

Was first created for a friend. Now I use it as an example for my own portfolio.

I learned a lot of tricks and cool effects while doing it, and it's kind of elegant in it's own way I like it.

I consider it more as an experiment than a real perfect fully-featured portfolio website. The code is not really good as well and I don't intend on rewriting it (not entirely).
